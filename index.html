        <h1>You got C#!</h1>
          <p>C# is a compiled language; it runs faster as a finished program than programs written in interpretive languages such as Python and JavaScript.</p>
      </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="box">
      <div id="swiftInfo" class="hidden">
        <h1>You got Swift!</h1>
          <p>Swift is a compiled language from Apple that is used in iPhone apps.
          </p>

    <div id="javaScriptInfo" class="hidden">
      <h1>You gotJavaScript!</h1>
        <p>With JavaScript, you can create interactive features that run in a Browser. As an interpretive language, there are less rules, and coding small tasks is happens faster than when coding with compiled languages!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div id="pythonInfo" class="hidden">
        <h1>You got Python</h1>
          <p>Python is a general purpose language. It is used in scientific applications, machine learning, and AI. In web based settings, Python is back end only, unlike JavaScript, which can be front and back end. However, similar to JavaScript, this language is interpretive; there are less rules, and coding small tasks is happens faster than when coding with compiled languages. </p>

      <div id="rubyInfo" class="hidden">
        <h1>You got Ruby!</h1>
          <p>Designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto to be fun and productive to use. "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves." Although Ruby is more often interpreted, it can be both interpreted and compiled depending on the implementation.</p>

      <div id="teaInfo" class="hidden">
        <h1>Hold on there!</h1>
          <p>Programmers have a universal preference to coffee over tea, so if you want to learn to code, you better start liking coffee. Sorry, this is a non-starter pal.</p>
